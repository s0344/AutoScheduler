# modified A star search with back tracking
# modified part: choose the mandatory course with the least section to start with
# g(): choose the class that prune the least class
# h(): "by constantly deleting all the conflict class in the pool"we achieve the concept of always having the best option for next step.
# backtrack: go back one step if no result until the root is empty
# priority - mandatory -> level limit -> other classes
